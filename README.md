#  cloud

This is a NodeJS application used for file uploading to the "Cloud".
It was written as a Senior prom work for my final grade.

I wrote it in a month with no previous JS experience or backend technologies.
It covers the main function of handling user's files in a folder over the network.

Backend done in NodeJS with Express framework using multer middleware and EJS view engine.
