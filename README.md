# cloud

This is a NodeJS application used for file uploading to the "Cloud".
It was written as a Senior prom work for my final grade.
I wrote it in a month with no previous JS experience or backend technologies.
It covers the main function of handling user's files in a folder over the network.

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mastelic/cloud.git
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```
